{"question": " The primary magnetic field propagates through two pathways:\nThe first excitation method is that electromagnetic waves first propagate rapidly through the air to every point on the Earth's surface, and then a portion of the electromagnetic energy is transmitted from the surface to the subsurface. According to Huygens' principle, each point on the wavefront is considered as a new spherical wave source, so each point on the Earth's surface becomes a wave source successively, transmitting partial electromagnetic waves into the subsurface. In the far field, this primary magnetic field can be considered as an inhomogeneous plane wave that propagates along the vertical direction into the Earth.\nThe second excitation method is that electromagnetic energy directly propagates from the source to the subsurface, similar to the induction of currents in a conductive medium like the \"smoke ring\", gradually spreading deeper underground over time.\nThe first propagation method is instantaneously established, and due to the Earth's electrical reactance, the establishment of the second field is relatively delayed.\nSo, in the process of diffusion of transient electromagnetic fields, the characteristics of early and late propagation are:\nA. Far fieldâearly stageâdominated by the second excitation method, near fieldâlate stageâdominated by the first excitation method\nB.
