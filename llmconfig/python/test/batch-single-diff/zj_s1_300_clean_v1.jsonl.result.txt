In order to provide lithochemical constraints on granite petrogenesis, this paper presents a compilation and synthesis of available experimental data for the major element compositions of felsic melts derived from partial melting of natural or synthetic materials in the compositional range of crustal rocks. The experimental melts are categorized into four types according to the species ofhydrousminerals in startingmaterials: (I) amphibole-bearing; (II) amphiboleand biotite-bearing; (III) biotite-bearing; and (IV) biotite- andmuscovite-bearing. Ifdehydrationmelting takes place at normal crustal conditions (P = 5–10 kbar, T ≤ 1000 °C), experimental melts are rich in SiO2 but poor in MgO + FeOT except those from amphibole-bearing sources. A comprehensive comparison ofcompositions between experimental melts and starting materials indicates that geochemical fractionation is variable for different major elements and their ratios. Source composition andmelting temperature exert stronger controls on thecompositional variations ofexperimental melts than pressure and fluid. By comparing the experimentalmelts with natural granites, the following insights into granite petrogenesis can be got: (1) while peritectic assemblage entrainment may be the dominant mechanism for the compositional variations of garnet/cordierite-rich S-type granites, fractional crystallization of diverse melts from heterogeneous metasedimentary precursors probably governs the compositional variations of garnet/cordierite-poor S-type granites; (2) relatively K2O-rich mafic to intermediate rocks are appropriate sources for calc-alkaline I-type granites. The compositional variations of calc-alkaline granites are jointly controlledby peritectic assemblage entrainment and subsequent fractional crystallization; (3)while dehydration melting at T N 950 °C is appropriate for the production of ferroan and alkali-rich granitic melts from intermediate magnesian tonalite or granodiorite, it is also possible for ferroan, alkali–rich and fluorine-rich granitic melts to be produced by dehydrationmelting ofmoderatelymagnesianmica–bearing materials at T ≤ 900 °C. Nevertheless, the low-Tmelts are more peraluminous than the high-T ones.

The low-Mg rocks can be classified into low-silica (SiO2 < 70% wt.%) granodiorites (Fig. 3B) and high-silica (SiO2 > 70% wt.%) monzogranites and syenogranites (Fig. 3C, D). The high-silica samples were likely produced by fractionation from magmas of low-silica rocks based on the following pieces of evidence. First, the low-silica and high-silica samples have similar zircon εHf(t) values (Fig. 4J), indicating they are cogenetic. Second, the convex curves of Zr, P2O5, and Ba on the Harker diagrams (Fig. 8A–C) from low-silica to high-silica samples generally reflect a process of gradual saturation and segregation of zircon, apatite, feldspar, and biotite (Huang et al., 2011; Lee and Bachmann, 2014). These signatures are inconsistent with the trend of mineral accumulation (Deering et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2021), indicating granites in this study likely represent frozen liquids. The linear trend in the SiO2 vs. (Dy/Yb)N diagram (Fig. 8D) implies that amphibole was a major fractionating phase (Davidson et al., 2007). The marked Ti and P anomalies in the high-silica samples indicate the separation of titanite and apatite (Fig. 5F). Third, quantitative modeling based on trace elements shows that the high-silica granites can be generated by fractionation of plagioclase + K-feldspar + amphibole + biotite (30:20:30:20) with separation degrees of 5–20% from less evolved melts represented by sample 14MM34 (Fig. 8E). Two syenogranite samples (14MM18 and 14MM23) with low ∑REE and concave-upward medium-REE patterns are likely related to the separation of accessory minerals (i.e., titanite and apatite; Wu et al., 2003) and amphibole as indicated by the REE Rayleigh modeling (Fig. 8F).\"", "answer": "Yes, I understand the task.
